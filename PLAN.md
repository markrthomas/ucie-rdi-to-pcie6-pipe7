# PLAN.md — UCIe RDI → PCIe PIPE 7.1 (Gen5/Gen6) MAC-Facing Bridge

> Portable blueprint for a **new repo**. Drop this in as `PLAN.md`, then execute the
> phased closure plan one item per commit (the workflow this author already uses).

## Context

The predecessor repo (`IP-ucie-rdi-to-pcie-pipe`) is a UCIe 1.0 RDI ↔ "PIPE-labeled"
CDC bridge. Its `pipe_*` ports are a **generic valid/ready/data/error handshake plus a
demo CRC** — none of the real PIPE control/status signalling (PowerDown, Rate, Width,
PhyStatus, RxStatus, message bus, 128b/130b block framing) exists. It is functionally a
dual-clock elastic-buffer datapath with PIPE naming.

This project builds the **real thing**: a bridge whose downstream port is a genuine
**PIPE 7.1 MAC-facing interface** (the bridge plays the MAC/controller role and talks
to a PIPE PHY). It reuses the predecessor's proven **repo shape, DV methodology, and
build/CI discipline**, but replaces the stub datapath with a spec-accurate PIPE MAC.

**Locked scope decisions:**
- **Datapath architecture:** PIPE **SerDes Architecture** (async PHY interface, 8-bit
  **M2P/P2M message bus** carries most control/status; minimal discrete pins).
- **Rates/modes:** **Gen5 + Gen6** only — 32 GT/s **128b/130b** and 64 GT/s **PAM4**
  (`Rate=4`/`Rate=5`). No legacy Gen1–4 rate ladder. (Note: PCIe "FLIT mode" is a
  controller/PCIe-base concept *above* the PIPE interface — see item 0; the bridge does
  not build flits on the PIPE side.)
- **Role:** **MAC-facing only.** We drive MAC-owned signals and react to PHY-owned ones;
  we do **not** model PHY internals (SerDes, precoding math, CDR, elec-idle detection).
- **Build-out:** **Phased closure plan**, one numbered item per commit.

**Intended outcome:** a lint-clean, Verilator-smoke-gated, UVM-verified UCIe-RDI-to-PIPE-7.1
MAC bridge IP with the same "authored-and-review-validated" DV rigor as the predecessor,
where UVM is VCS-only and Verilator is the open-source CI gate.

### RTL module inventory (mirrors predecessor's `src/` granularity)

| Module | Role | Reuse from predecessor? |
|--------|------|--------------------------|
| `ucie_rdi_to_pipe7_mac_bridge.sv` | Top; per-lane generate; wires control + datapath | Structure/genvar pattern from `ucie_rdi_to_pcie_pipe_bridge.sv` |
| `pipe7_cdc_elastic_buf.sv` | Dual-clock Gray-pointer elastic buffer (RDI↔PCLK) | **Port directly** from `ucie_rdi_fifo_cdc.sv` (proven, formally checked) |
| `pipe7_mac_ctrl_fsm.sv` | PowerDown/Rate/Width request sequencing; **gated on `PhyStatus`** | New (net-new core) |
| `pipe7_msgbus_master.sv` | M2P/P2M 8-bit message-bus master FSM; register read/write transactions | New (net-new core) |
| `pipe7_tx_framer.sv` | Gen5 128b/130b block build (MAC embeds 2b sync header in TxData); Gen6 wide-data path (no 128b/130b sync header) | New |
| `pipe7_rx_deframer.sv` | Block alignment, sync-header check, RxStatus decode | New |
| `pipe7_regfile.sv` | PIPE register space accessed over message bus (Tx eq presets/de-emphasis in PHY Tx Control regs, Rx margining, `PAM4RestrictedLevels`; no FEC register) | New |
| `pipe7_pkg.sv` | Params, rate/power/width enums, message-bus opcode/addr constants | New (analogous to centralizing constants) |

### Signal set the bridge OWNS (MAC → PHY, must drive)
> Corrected per item 0 for the SerDes architecture (crosscheck §E).
- **Tx data (SerDes arch):** `TxData[N-1:0]` (N ∈ {10,20,40,80,160}, set by `Width`),
  `TxDataValid`. **No** `TxStartBlock`/`TxSyncHeader`/`TxDataK` — those are Original-PIPE
  -only; in SerDes the MAC does the 128b/130b coding and embeds the 2b sync header in
  `TxData` itself. At Gen6 (64 GT/s) there is no 128b/130b sync header at all.
- **Tx control:** `TxElecIdle[3:0]`, `TxDetectRx/Loopback` (loopback N/A in SerDes — we
  drive it only for receiver-detect). Tx margin/compliance are **msg-bus registers** in
  SerDes, not discrete pins.
- **Command/config:** `PowerDown[3:0]`, `Rate[3:0]` (Gen5=`4`, Gen6=`5`), `Width[2:0]`,
  `RxWidth[2:0]`, `Reset#` (active-low, async).
- **Message-bus master:** `M2P_MessageBus[7:0]` transactions (Tx eq presets/de-emphasis
  in PHY Tx Control regs, Rx margining, `PAM4RestrictedLevels`). No FEC register exists.

### Signal set the bridge SAMPLES + reacts to (PHY → MAC)
> Corrected per item 0 for the SerDes architecture (crosscheck §F).
- **Rx data:** `RxData[N-1:0]` synchronous to the recovered clock **`RxCLK`** (not PCLK),
  `RxValid` (in SerDes = "RxCLK stable", not block-aligned). **No** `RxStartBlock`/
  `RxSyncHeader` (Original-PIPE-only) — the MAC recovers block start / decodes the sync
  header out of `RxData`. `RxStatus[2:0]` — only `0b011` "Receiver detected" applies in
  SerDes; SKP/decode/EB-error codes are Original-PIPE-only (EB lives in the MAC).
- **`PhyStatus`** — single-cycle completion for power/rate/width changes (async when PCLK
  is absent). Rate/Width change only in **P0 or P1** with `TxElecIdle` asserted. Completion
  latency is **PHY-specific** (parameterize the item-7 assertion). In PCLK-as-PHY-input
  mode add the `PclkChangeOk`→`PclkChangeAck` handshake.
- `RxElecIdle` (async; at Gen5/Gen6 the MAC must detect EI-*entry* with its own logic,
  not trust this pin), `RxStandbyStatus`, `P2M_MessageBus[7:0]` responses.

### PIPE-7.1-specific deltas built in from day one
> Reconciled with the spec in item 0 (crosscheck §B/§C/§I).
- **Gen6 at the PIPE interface is *not* "FLIT mode".** "Flit" is a PCIe-base concept above
  PIPE (0 occurrences in PIPE 7.1). At 64 GT/s (`Rate=5`) the datapath is wider `TxData`/
  `RxData` with **no** 128b/130b sync header; the 256B flit + FEC + LCRC are built
  controller-side and arrive on RDI. The bridge does **not** frame flits on the PIPE side.
  (This still replaces the predecessor's zero-extend mapping, which cannot carry real
  block/flit-formatted data.)
- **New Rate encoding**: `Rate[3:0]`, Gen5=`4` (32 GT/s), Gen6=`5` (64 GT/s); each rate
  change completes via a single-cycle `PhyStatus` (+ optional PCLK handshake).
- **L0p** is realized by an ordinary `Width`/`RxWidth` change using the standard
  rate/width→`PhyStatus` handshake — **no** dedicated L0p PIPE handshake or "partial
  width" pins exist.
- **PAM4 precoding**: PHY does the mapping/gray-code/precode; the MAC's only PAM4 register
  knob is `PAM4RestrictedLevels` (there is no generic "precoding-enable" register).
- **FEC / flit-LCRC** live on the **controller/RDI** side; the PIPE interface has **no FEC
  signalling or register** — the bridge sizes the RDI datapath for them but nothing FEC
  crosses the PIPE boundary.

## DV environment (three-tier model)

> Extends the predecessor's two-tier model with a **third, independent, open-source-runnable
> tier: a PyUVM environment on Cocotb** whose sole job is to **cross-check** the SV/Verilator
> and UVM environments. The value is *independent-implementation diversity*: a reference model
> and checker written independently — in Python, on a different simulator — makes a
> **common-mode modelling bug** (the same wrong assumption baked into both DUT and its SV
> checker) far less likely to pass silently. When Tier 1 and Tier 1b agree with the DUT,
> confidence is high; when they disagree, exactly one of the three (DUT, SV TB, Python TB) has
> the bug — and we know to look.
>
> **Why PyUVM specifically (not raw cocotb coroutines):** PyUVM is UVM 1.2 implemented in
> Python on top of cocotb — same component taxonomy as our Tier-2 SV/UVM env (uvm_test / env /
> agent / driver / monitor / sequencer / sequence / scoreboard, the factory, and ConfigDB /
> TLM analysis ports). Mirroring the UVM structure lets the two envs **share *test intent* and
> sequence/scoreboard architecture 1:1**, so a Tier-2 UVM sequence has a direct PyUVM
> counterpart and divergences are easy to localize. The diversity that catches common-mode
> bugs is preserved where it matters — **independent language, independent reference-model
> implementation, independent simulator** — while the methodology is deliberately kept
> *aligned* with UVM so the cross-check compares like-for-like. (Constraints use Python
> `random`/`constraint` libs, not SV constraint blocks; coverage via `cocotb-coverage`.)

**Tier 1 — Verilator open-source CI gate** (fast, always-run):
- Smoke TB + reference scoreboard + assertion monitor, clocks from `sim_main.cpp`.
- `NUM_LANES=1` param smoke (`sim_main_nl1.cpp`).
- Line coverage via `--coverage` → `coverage.info` + `coverage_summary` awk target.
- A **lightweight PHY-responder stub** (SV, non-UVM) that answers `PhyStatus`, returns
  `RxStatus`/`RxData`, and services message-bus reads — enough to exercise the FSM.

**Tier 1b — PyUVM-on-Cocotb parallel cross-check (Python, open-source, *runnable* in this env):**
- Built with **PyUVM** (UVM 1.2 in Python) driving the DUT via **Cocotb** on **Verilator
  (preferred) or Icarus** — both already on PATH via oss-cad-suite — so unlike UVM (Tier 2)
  this tier **actually executes** in OSS CI, giving a *second* runnable gate rather than an
  authored-only one. (SV-feature caveat: package/interface/`always_ff` support is stronger
  under cocotb+Verilator than under Icarus; the framer/msgbus DUTs are validated against
  Verilator first.)
- **PyUVM env structure (mirrors the Tier-2 UVM taxonomy):** `uvm_test` → `uvm_env` holding a
  `ucie_rdi_agent` (sequencer/driver/monitor, active) and a `pipe7_phy_responder_agent`
  (PHY-side responder), a `uvm_scoreboard` fed over `uvm_analysis_port`s, and a `pipe7_seq_lib`
  of `uvm_sequence`s. Wiring via the PyUVM **factory** + **ConfigDB**.
- **Independent Python reference models** (the checker logic behind the scoreboard),
  deliberately *not* ported from the SV scoreboard:
  - a payload/framing model (RDI ↔ 128b/130b Gen5 & Gen6 wide-data round-trip),
  - a control-plane model (legal `PowerDown`/`Rate`/`Width` → single-cycle `PhyStatus`
    completion; illegal transitions flagged),
  - a message-bus transactor + register model (M2P/P2M framing, opcode set, 12-bit addr).
- **Cross-check mechanism (two modes):**
  1. *Shared golden vectors* — the SV smoke TB and the PyUVM sequences consume the **same**
     exported stimulus+expected vector set; a divergence between the two reference models on
     identical stimulus localizes a TB bug independently of the DUT.
  2. *Independent constrained-random* — PyUVM sequences drive their own seeded CRT stimulus
     (Python `constraint`/`random`) through the Python model, then the same seed/vectors are
     exportable for the SV/UVM env for back-to-back comparison.
- **A PyUVM PHY-responder agent** mirroring the SV/UVM `pipe7_phy_responder_agent` behaviour
  (spec-timed `PhyStatus`/`RxStatus`/`P2M`), so the control-plane proof is corroborated by an
  independently-authored responder with the same component role.
- **Coverage parity check:** PyUVM functional coverage (`cocotb-coverage`) compared against the
  SV/UVM covergroup bins to catch coverage-model divergence (a bin one env counts and the other
  silently doesn't).
- **Explicit non-goals:** does **not** replace the Verilator smoke gate or UVM; it is a
  corroboration layer. Introduced as an *advisory* CI job (`continue-on-error`) and promoted
  to a hard gate once green and stable.

**Tier 2 — UVM (VCS/UVM 1.2), authored-and-review-validated, not in OSS CI:**
- **`ucie_rdi_agent`** (active): drives RDI TX, monitors accepted beats, publishes expected.
- **`pipe7_phy_responder_agent`** (the key new BFM): a **PHY-side responder** that drives
  `PhyStatus`/`RxStatus`/`RxData`/`P2M`, and *answers* `PowerDown`/`Rate`/`Width` requests
  with spec-timed completion handshakes. This replaces the predecessor's trivial
  ready-driver. One well-defined role — not a full PHY model.
- **`pipe7_mac_monitor`** (passive): observes MAC-side Tx + control transitions.
- **Scoreboard:** per-lane ordering queues (reuse the predecessor's queue+drain pattern),
  **plus** a control-plane checker (every power/rate/width request eventually completes via
  `PhyStatus`; illegal transitions flagged) and a message-bus transaction checker.
- **Coverage:** reuse per-lane valid/error/occupancy covergroups; **add** Rate×Width cross,
  PowerDown-state cross, Gen6-wide-vs-Gen5-130b framing-mode coverage, message-bus opcode coverage,
  PhyStatus-latency bins.

**Formal:** port the predecessor's SymbiYosys CDC/handshake proofs onto
`pipe7_cdc_elastic_buf`; add FSM safety props (no `Rate` change while not in the right
PowerDown state; no Tx data while `TxElecIdle`).

---

## Build / CI (reuse predecessor targets verbatim where possible)

Makefile target set to replicate: `lint`, `regress` (lint + Verilator smoke = CI gate),
`regress_cov`, `regress_nl1`, `coverage_summary`, `ci` (regress + cov + nl1 + docs_check),
`cocotb` (Tier 1b PyUVM-on-Cocotb cross-check; `SIM=verilator` default, `SIM=icarus` alt),
`uvm`/`uvm_compile`/`uvm_run` (via `test/uvm/Makefile.vcs`), `formal`, `docs_check`, `clean`.
Vendor flows (`simv`/`questa`/`xsim`) compile `sim_top.sv`. CI runs `make regress` then
`verilator_cov` + `verilator_nl1`, matching `.github/workflows`. A separate **`cocotb`**
CI job (`pip install -r test/cocotb/requirements.txt`, then `make cocotb SIM=verilator`)
runs as **`continue-on-error: true`** advisory at first and is promoted to a required gate
once stable — it must never block the Verilator release gate while being brought up.

## Phased closure plan (one numbered item per commit)

> Each item is self-contained, lint-clean, and leaves `make regress` green. Advance one

> **Provenance caveat — RESOLVED (2026-07-23).** The signal names, message-bus

> originally working-knowledge placeholders. **Item 0 is now complete**: they were
> reconciled against the official **Intel PIPE 7.1 spec (Ref 643108, Rev 7.1, Sep 2025)**
> — see `docs/pipe71_spec_crosscheck.md` for the row-by-row verdicts. Corrections are

> (a) Gen6 is **not** "FLIT mode" *at the PIPE interface* — "flit" is a PCIe-base concept
> above PIPE (0 occurrences in PIPE 7.1); the bridge passes already-framed data as
> `TxData`/`RxData`, it does not build 256B flits on the PIPE side.
> (b) In the **SerDes architecture the MAC owns 128b/130b encode/decode + block
> alignment** (PHY is parallel↔serial only), so `TxStartBlock`/`TxSyncHeader`/
> `RxStartBlock`/`RxSyncHeader`/`TxDataK`/`RxDataK` **do not exist** on this interface.
> (c) Field widths: `PowerDown[3:0]`, `Rate[3:0]` (Gen5=`4`, Gen6=`5`), `TxElecIdle[3:0]`,
> `Width[2:0]` + separate `RxWidth[2:0]`; SerDes `TxData` is 10/20/40/80/160 bits.
> (d) L0p is an ordinary `Width` change, not a special PIPE handshake; PhyStatus
> completion latency is PHY-specific (parameterized), not a spec constant; there is **no
> FEC register** on the PIPE interface.

0. **Spec cross-check + errata sheet.** Obtain the controlled **PIPE 7.1** spec (and the
   relevant **PCIe 6.x base** sections for FLIT/PAM4/L0p). Produce
   `docs/pipe71_spec_crosscheck.md` that, for each item this plan asserts, records
   **spec §ref → confirmed / corrected / N-A**, covering at minimum: SerDes-architecture
   signal list and directions; M2P/P2M message-bus framing, opcodes, and register
   addresses; Gen5/Gen6 `Rate` and `PowerDown`/`Width` encodings; PhyStatus completion
   semantics and max-latency bounds; flit size and sync-header/block-type rules; L0p
   partial-width handshake; and which functions are MAC-owned vs PHY-owned. Fold every
   correction back into this PLAN before starting item 1. **Blocks items 2–12.**
1. **Repo skeleton + CDC port.** Scaffold dirs, `pipe7_pkg.sv`, port
   `ucie_rdi_fifo_cdc.sv` → `pipe7_cdc_elastic_buf.sv`, Makefile + CI + `sim_main.cpp`,
   Verilator lint/smoke green on a datapath-only pass-through. Port formal props for the buf.
2. **PIPE MAC interface skeleton.** `pipe7_mac_if.sv` + `docs/interface_spec.md` +
   `docs/pipe71_mac_signal_map.md` enumerating every MAC-owned/PHY-owned signal and the
   register map. No behavior yet — contract first.
3. **PowerDown/Rate/Width control FSM** (`pipe7_mac_ctrl_fsm.sv`) **gated on `PhyStatus`.**
   Add the Verilator PHY-responder stub so the FSM can complete handshakes; smoke-test
   P0↔P0s↔P1↔P2 and Gen5↔Gen6 rate changes.
4. **Message-bus master** (`pipe7_msgbus_master.sv` + `pipe7_regfile.sv`). M2P/P2M framing
   (4-bit commands, 12-bit addr, 8-bit data; NOP/write_uncommitted/write_committed/read/
   read_completion/write_ack); register read/write. Registers per item 0: Tx eq presets/
   de-emphasis in PHY Tx Control regs (`0x400`+), Rx margining in Rx Margin Control/Status,
   PAM4 config via the `PAM4RestrictedLevels` field. **No** "precoding-enable" or FEC register.
5. **Gen5 128b/130b TX framer + RX deframer** (**MAC-owned in SerDes arch**). Sync-header
   build/check + block alignment done in the bridge and embedded in `TxData`/`RxData` —
   there are **no** discrete `TxSyncHeader`/`TxStartBlock`/`RxSyncHeader`/`RxStartBlock`
   pins. Scoreboard checks RDI payload ↔ framed PIPE data round-trip.
6. **Gen6 (64 GT/s) datapath** (`Rate=5`). Wider `TxData`/`RxData` with **no** 128b/130b
   sync header (Gen6 is 1b/1b at the PIPE datapath; flit/FEC/LCRC are controller-side and
   arrive on RDI — the bridge does **not** build 256B flits here). Covers Gen6 rate/width
   change + `PhyStatus` (+ PCLK-input handshake) timing, the `PAM4RestrictedLevels` config
   path, and L0p realized as an ordinary `Width`/`RxWidth` change (no special handshake).
7. **Protocol assertions** (`pipe7_mac_bridge_assertions.sv`): no Tx while `TxElecIdle`,
   Rate change only in legal PowerDown, PhyStatus completion within bound, sync-header legality.
8. **UVM base env** (`pipe7_mac_pkg.sv`): RDI active agent + MAC passive monitor +
   per-lane scoreboard (port predecessor's queue/drain), base + sanity test, `Makefile.vcs`.
9. **UVM PHY-responder agent** — the spec-timed `PhyStatus`/`RxStatus`/`P2M` BFM answering
   power/rate/width requests; wire into env; control-plane scoreboard checker.
10. **UVM RX path + message-bus checker** — RX Gen5 130b + Gen6 wide-data stimulus, mirrored
    RX queues, message-bus transaction scoreboard.
11. **Functional coverage closure** — Rate×Width, PowerDown-state, framing-mode,
    message-bus-opcode, PhyStatus-latency covergroups; report in README metrics.
12. **Docs + coverage sign-off** — finalize `architecture.md`, `verification_plan.md`,
    `uvm_verification.md`; `docs_check` target; record line-coverage baseline. (If the
    Cocotb tier, items 13–14, lands after this, re-run the docs/coverage sign-off.)
13. **PyUVM-on-Cocotb cross-check — env + datapath.** Stand up `test/cocotb/` (Tier 1b) as a
    **PyUVM** env: `pipe7_pyuvm_env.py` (uvm_env + scoreboard + analysis ports), the active
    `agents/ucie_rdi_agent.py`, an **independent** Python framing reference model
    (`models/framing_model.py`), and `test_datapath.py` (a `uvm_test`) cross-checking the
    RDI↔PIPE payload/framing round-trip against the SV scoreboard via **shared golden
    vectors**. `Makefile` (`SIM=verilator` default) + advisory (`continue-on-error`) `cocotb`
    CI job. *Ordering:* schedulable any time after item 5 (Gen5 framer) — does not depend on
    the SV/UVM tier.
14. **PyUVM cross-check — control plane, message bus, coverage parity.** Add the PyUVM
    `agents/phy_responder_agent.py`, `ctrl_plane_model.py` + `test_ctrl_plane.py` (every
    `PowerDown`/`Rate`/`Width` → `PhyStatus` completion; illegal transitions flagged),
    `msgbus_model.py` + `test_msgbus.py` (M2P/P2M framing + register model), a
    `seq_lib/pipe7_seq_lib.py` sharing test intent with the SV/UVM sequences, and a
    `cocotb-coverage` parity check against the SV/UVM covergroup bins. Promote the `cocotb`
    CI job from advisory to a required gate once green. *Ordering:* after items 3–4 (control
    FSM + msgbus) and item 13.

## Verification (how to prove it end-to-end)

- **Per commit:** `make lint && make regress` must stay green (lint-clean + Verilator
  smoke with `[SCOREBOARD] PASS`), plus `make regress_nl1` for the `NUM_LANES=1` gate.
- **Coverage:** `make regress_cov` → `coverage.info`; `make coverage_summary` prints the
  line-coverage table. Keep README's coverage claim in sync (predecessor gates this in
  `docs_check`).
- **Control-plane proof:** the PHY-responder + control-plane scoreboard checker must show
  every `PowerDown`/`Rate`/`Width` request reaching a `PhyStatus` completion, and illegal
  transitions flagged — this is the item with no predecessor analog, so it is the primary
  new sign-off gate.
- **Framing proof:** scoreboard round-trips RDI payload through Gen5 130b **and** Gen6
  wide-data framing back to RDI; upper/lower field mapping checked per mode (not the old
  zero-extend).
- **UVM (VCS):** `make uvm` compiles + runs the sanity test; review-validate (this env is
  authored-not-run in the OSS environment, per the predecessor's convention).
- **PyUVM cross-check (Tier 1b):** `make cocotb SIM=verilator` runs the PyUVM env (UVM 1.2 in
  Python on cocotb) with its independent Python reference models against the same DUT.
  **Cross-check pass criterion:** on the shared golden vectors the SV scoreboard and the PyUVM
  scoreboard must agree with the DUT *and with each other*; any three-way disagreement fails
  the job and localizes the bug to DUT vs SV-TB vs Python-TB. Advisory in CI until stable, then
  a required gate. Runs in this OSS environment (unlike the VCS UVM tier).
- **Formal:** `make formal` (SymbiYosys) for CDC-buf invariants + FSM safety props.

## Key reuse pointers (from predecessor repo)

- **CDC elastic buffer** — port `src/ucie_rdi_fifo_cdc.sv` wholesale; it is the one proven,
  formally-checked block and needs only PCLK-domain renaming.
- **Scoreboard queue/drain pattern** — per-lane `exp_q[$]` with `check_phase` drain
  (`ucie_rdi_pcie_pkg.sv`) transfers directly to the framed datapath.
- **Two-tier DV split** — Verilator = OSS CI gate, UVM = VCS-only growth path
  (`docs/verification_plan.md` environment map).
- **Makefile target vocabulary** — copy `regress` / `regress_cov` / `regress_nl1` / `ci` /
  `docs_check` names so muscle memory and CI carry over.

## Explicitly out of scope
PHY internals (SerDes, PAM4 precoding math, CDR, elec-idle detection); FEC/flit-LCRC codec
(controller-side); Gen1–4 legacy rates; the predecessor's demo CRC (`0x17047432` residue) —
it is unrelated to Gen6 flit CRC and is dropped from the PIPE interface entirely.
